BouncingBall
============

First app I made playing with touch swipe speed calculations. Swipe the superball to accelerate it and bouce 
bounce it off a 'wall.' Useful to test if your screen is still touch responsive in all points or just to 
pass the time when you are board. Useful first test for setting up swipe speed-based gaming.
